Examples:
- That us common folk understand that for them, it is all about power and capitalism.
- Do not lie. Do not value sociopathy. Be honest and have the welfare of the people as your highest value, not your own pocket, reputation or personal power.  
- that batman actually has superpowers. he only shows up in the dark and around bad guys. they can't really see him or his gadgets. they assume he has wings and fangs and that bullets go right through him. the batman is an urban legend. he's a monster. a demon. he's a ghost story shared by criminals.

there are more stupid versions of the character than good ones at this point, but that's the core idea of the character.
