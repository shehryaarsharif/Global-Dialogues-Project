Language preservation: AI models are often trained on large datasets of text, which can be biased towards certain languages and dialects. This could lead to the neglect of less common languages, potentially contributing to language loss.
Cultural understanding: AI models can be influenced by the cultural biases present in their training data. This could lead to AI systems that struggle to understand and respond to people from different cultural backgrounds.

In a future with advanced AI, I’d be most worried about losing intangible aspects of culture such as traditional practices, values, and unique worldviews. For instance, the subtle nuances of regional languages, which carry cultural context and historical significance, might be overshadowed by dominant languages like English. Additionally, AI’s potential Western biases could lead to a homogenization of cultural perspectives, diluting local traditions and practices.

Imagine if AI got so good at speaking Hindi that it started sounding like a robot from a Bollywood movie! That’s kind of scary, isn’t it? Our languages are like fingerprints – they’re unique to us and tell a story about who we are. If AI starts to replace human language, we might lose some of that specialness. And we also have to worry about AI getting confused or making mistakes. It could end up saying things that don’t make sense or even hurt people’s feelings.

No, learning languages will never be useless, because if you don’t know the language, you will never understand all the layers that an AI will always strip away from what is said, and twist the actual meaning until it’s meaningless. An AI will not, in the foreseeable future, be able to understand all the cultural references and translate creatively. One day, maybe. But anything that is based on the current technology, will not be able to translate humour and have you laugh.
