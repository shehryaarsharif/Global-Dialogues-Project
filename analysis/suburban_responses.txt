Local traditions. AI gets too much information and many things can get mixed.

My dialect calls some things different, and with the amount of new residents in my city, these different words are forgotten and even mocked online. Imagine if it's all AI.

As AI technology evolves, I’m worried about losing the nuanced aspects of cultural identity. Specifically, I fear that AI might not accurately capture or represent the deep-rooted traditions and values that define different cultures. There’s a risk that AI could prioritize mainstream perspectives, overshadowing unique cultural practices. This could result in a loss of cultural richness and individuality, as AI may not fully reflect or respect the subtleties of various traditions.
